STATUS: COMPLETE — Phases 0 + 1 shipped 2026-06-23, merged to `main`,
  archived. Phase 0 rebuilt the backend sun-path service in
  `project_location` (it was deleted 2026-06-22); Phase 1 renders it in the
  Model-Viewer Site & Sun lens. D-SP-1 accepted. Phase 2 (scrubber)
  deferred — see the model-viewer-post-mvp roster. See STATUS.md.
AUTHOR: Claude (for Ed)
SCOPE: The annual sun-path diagram in the Model Viewer Site & Sun lens —
  both the project-scoped backend service that computes it and the 3D
  render that draws it over the building geometry. Plus the deferred
  time/season scrubber.

# Model Viewer — Sun Path

Completes the Site & Sun lens. The MVP shipped the lens with building
geometry, grey non-selectable shades, a north marker, and a quiet
"Set project location to see the sun path" hint. The frontend renderer
is a partial stub (it draws only the dashed analemmas, from the
always-`null` `/model_data` `sun_path` key). This feature stands the
sun-path service back up and completes the renderer (monthly arcs +
compass), fit to the model bounds.

Scope:

- **Backend sun-path service** — `project_location` builder + project-
  scoped `GET /projects/{id}/sun-path` endpoint + MCP tool, reading the
  existing `project_location` row → **Phase 0**.
- **Site & Sun 3D render** — the frontend consumer of Phase 0 → **Phase 1**.
- **Sun-path scrubber** (Q-VIEW-6; deferred roster item) → **Phase 2**,
  gated until Phase 1 ships and a time/season interaction has a real use
  case.

## Read order

1. `STATUS.md` — the build/delete history and where the code stands today.
2. `decisions.md` — D-SP-1 (decouple from the immutable `/model_data`
   artifact, accepted 2026-06-13) and the 2026-06-23 reconciliation note
   (backend lives in `project_location`, not "Climate").
3. `PRD.md` — behavior + the backend/frontend contracts.
4. `PLAN.md` — phase sequence and build order.
5. `phases/phase-00-backend-sun-path-service.md` — rebuild the backend.
6. `phases/phase-01-static-sun-path.md` — the frontend render.
7. `phases/phase-02-scrubber.md` — deferred sub-phase contract.

## Prerequisites

- **`project_location` feature** — data (`latitude`, `longitude`,
  `elevation_m`, `true_north_deg`, `time_zone`) + setter UI. **Met.**
  The Climate overhaul left these columns intact; the sun-path service
  reads them via `project_location.repository.get_location(...)`.
- **Model Viewer MVP** — Site & Sun lens stub keyed off `sunPath != null`
  and the geometry/`model.bounds` the render fits to. **Met.**

## Current decision

D-SP-1 (serving strategy) is **accepted** (Ed 2026-06-13): the sun path
is a separate, project-scoped, location-reactive endpoint — **not** baked
into the immutable `/model_data` artifact. The 2026-06-23 reconciliation
(`decisions.md`) records where that endpoint lives: `project_location`
(which owns the coordinates), **not** the app-wide Climate
reference-dataset feature. No open decisions block implementation.

# Apertures Feature Status

## Current State

- **Phases 01, 02, 03, and 04 — additive variants shipped.** New `Aperture*`
  domain model, `tables.apertures[]` field, command seam, coverage
  invariant, default factory, route + service wrapper, full
  frontend tab, the SVG canvas substrate (geometry helpers,
  `ApertureSvgCanvas`, canvas toolbar with zoom + view-direction
  controls, `ApertureCanvasContainer`), and the interaction overlay
  (`ApertureCanvasOverlay`, `ApertureHitTarget`, `ApertureNamePill`,
  Zustand builder store, selection model, Clear-selection toolbar
  button, no-direct-delete inline notice) landed **side-by-side**
  with the existing Windows tracer-bullet. Nothing in the legacy
  tracer-bullet path was touched. See each phase file's
  "Implementation note" for the per-commit delta.
- **What's live now end-to-end:**
  - Open a project → click the new **Apertures** tab.
  - Empty state shows `No aperture types yet.` and a
    `+ Add aperture type` button.
  - `+ Add` dispatches `createApertureType` through
    `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/versions/{vid}/apertures/command`,
    the backend bookshelf-copies the seeded `PHN-Default-Frame`
    / `PHN-Default-Glazing` into a 1×1 aperture, the sidebar
    selects the new entry.
  - Hover-revealed Edit / Dup / Del row actions drive
    `renameApertureType` / `duplicateApertureType` /
    `deleteApertureType` through the same endpoint.
  - Rename dialog enforces collision (trim + case-insensitive)
    with a persistent helper line.
  - Locked versions and Viewer access hide every edit
    affordance; the list stays navigable.
  - Catalog seed rows (`PHN-Default-Frame`,
    `PHN-Default-Glazing`) are **not yet seeded by Alembic** —
    until that lands, `+ Add` returns a structured
    `aperture_default_refs_missing` error. The factory + adapter
    + dispatcher all handle that envelope gracefully; only the
    seed itself is missing.
- **Existing TB-08/TB-09 Windows tracer-bullet keeps working
  unmodified.** Both tabs coexist in the project nav.

## Still deferred (to a future cleanup phase, ideally before / with Phase 12)

- Rename `WindowTypeEntry` / `WindowElement` / `WindowElementFrames`
  → `Aperture*` and re-export the legacy names as aliases.
- Rename `body.tables.window_types` → `body.tables.apertures` with
  a `@computed_field` alias.
- Document-load migration shim that rewrites `win_` / `winel_`
  ids to `apt_` / `aptel_`.
- Alembic migration that munges existing JSON documents AND
  seeds the `PHN-Default-Frame` / `PHN-Default-Glazing` rows.
- Delete `frontend/src/features/windows/` and remove the
  `Windows` tab from `PROJECT_TABS`.
- `/projects/:id/windows` → `/projects/:id/apertures` redirect.
- Sidebar collapse / chevron, sticky `+ Add`, V1-pixel-parity
  styling.

## Next Step

Phase 05 split into two sub-PRs to keep change-sets reviewable:

- **Sub-PR A (shipped, this commit):** shared parser in
  `frontend/src/lib/units/length/` (ported verbatim from V1 + parens
  support for `evaluateSimpleExpression`) and the five backend
  dimension command handlers
  (`editDimension`, `addRow`, `addColumn`, `deleteRow`,
  `deleteColumn`) wired into `apply_aperture_command`. Dispatcher
  removes the five kinds from `_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_KINDS`. Phase 01's
  command model field names (`new_value_mm` / `at_index` /
  `height_mm` / `width_mm`) were preserved rather than renamed to
  the phase doc's `new_mm` / `position` / `default_dim_mm` —
  changing them would break the Phase 01 wire contract.
- **Sub-PR B (next):** Dimension UI — strips, edge-add hot-zones,
  delete dialog, format selector, total-dim caption, container
  composition.

## Blockers

- The Alembic seed of `PHN-Default-Frame` /
  `PHN-Default-Glazing` is needed before `+ Add aperture type`
  actually works in a live dev DB. Until that lands, the flow
  surfaces a structured 503 to the user rather than silently
  failing — acceptable transitional state, but worth folding
  into Phase 03 or a small cleanup commit.

## Verification

- Phase 01: commit `339e7ca`. `make ci` green.
- Phase 02: commit (prior). `make ci` green (525 backend tests, 1122
  frontend tests, build successful).
- Phase 03: prior commit. `make ci` green (525 backend tests, 1141
  frontend tests — 12 geometry + 7 canvas added, build successful).
- Phase 04: prior commit. `make ci` green (525 backend tests, 1161
  frontend tests — 6 store + 8 overlay + 6 pill added, build
  successful).
- Phase 05 sub-PR A: this commit. `make ci` green (536 backend
  tests — +11 for dimension commands; 1296 frontend tests — +135
  for shared parser modules: parseFeetInches 32, evaluateExpression
  41, parseInput 27, formatFeetInches 15, displayUnitConverter 20).

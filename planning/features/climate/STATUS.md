STATUS: Active — Phase 1 + Phase 2 implemented (2026-06-13). Phase 2
  ships the standardized `ClimateRecord`, the app-wide versioned dataset
  store, the Phius `-mon.txt` importer (now **revalidated against the real
  1007-station 2022 set** + a committed seed CLI), and dataset read
  endpoints + MCP. The PHI/PHPP xlsx importer is the one remaining slice
  (workbook now on disk; needs `openpyxl` + `io_climate.py` study). Phase 3
  (the tab) is unblocked; its setter-migration + tab-placement questions are
  resolved (see Decisions).

# Climate — Status

## Current state

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 implemented; Phase 3 in progress (sub-phase 3a
COMPLETE) — 2026-06-13.** `make ci` green (backend 800 passed; frontend
suite passing).

- **Phase 3a — COMPLETE (2026-06-13).** The Climate tab is live: `climate`
  tab added to `PROJECT_TABS` (right after Status); new
  `frontend/src/features/climate/` client (`types`/`api`/`query-keys`/
  `hooks`) over the `/api/v1/climate/datasets…` endpoints; a
  reference-dataset **browser** (dataset picker + country/region filter +
  nearest-to-project) with the standardized record rendered as read-only
  monthly + design-condition tables (IP/SI temperature toggle). **The rich
  location editor now lives in the Climate tab** (D-CL-3): the editor + EPW
  upload/parse flow were extracted into a reusable `useProjectLocationForm`
  hook + `ProjectLocationEditor`/`ProjectLocationSummary` components; the tab
  hosts the editable section with its own Save, and project **Settings now
  shows a compact read-only summary** that points to the Climate tab. Tests:
  `features/climate/__tests__/` (lib, api query builder, record-table render +
  unit toggle, `ClimateLocationSection` editor/viewer/EPW/late-resolve) +
  the slimmed `ProjectSettingsModal.location` read-only test.

- **Phase 1** — pure `build_sun_path(...)` + `GET …/sun-path` route +
  `get_project_sun_path` MCP tool in `backend/features/project_location/`.
  True-north sign verified by fixture as **identity** to ladybug's
  `north_angle` (D-PL-4). Committed `005839dc`.
- **Phase 2** — new `backend/features/climate/` module:
  - `record.py` — Pydantic v2 `ClimateRecord` mirroring
    `honeybee_ph.site` with `from_/to_honeybee_ph_site()` adapters,
    lossless round-trip verified (D-CL-10).
  - migration `20260613_0025` — app-wide `climate_dataset` +
    `climate_dataset_location` (versioned, JSONB record, geo + lat/long
    indexes).
  - `repository.py` / `service.py` — list/search/nearest/get + an
    idempotent `seed_dataset(...)` routine.
  - `importers/phius.py` — `-mon.txt` parser → `ClimateRecord` +
    `seed_phius_dataset(...)`, **revalidated against the real Phius 2022
    set (1007 stations, all 50 states parse + seed clean)**; the golden
    fixture is now a real, unmodified Worcester-MA station file.
  - `importers/__main__.py` — committed re-runnable seed CLI:
    `uv run python -m features.climate.importers --provider phius --root <dir>`.
  - `routes.py` — `GET /api/v1/climate/datasets`,
    `…/datasets/{id}/locations` (country/region + `near=lat,long`),
    `…/locations/{id}`.
  - `mcp.py` — `list_climate_datasets` / `search_climate_locations` /
    `get_climate_location` (app-wide; token-gated, no project scope).

**Phius revalidation — DONE (2026-06-13).** Ed's real Phius 2022 files
turned out to be on disk (gitignored under
`planning/features/climate/example_data/`). The blind-authored parser was
**rewritten against the verified real format** — packed label-scan header
rows, numeric-only design tails (Dewpoint/Sky design cells are metadata,
skipped), units/German stripping, albedo-from-sentence, country=US +
region from the file path. All 1007 files parse and seed clean (50 states;
honeybee round-trip stays lossless). The REVALIDATION NOTE is retired.

**Deferred within Phase 2:** the **PHI/PHPP xlsx seed importer** — the
PHPP workbook (`phi_phpp_10_6_climate_data.xlsx`) is now on disk too, but
reading it needs `openpyxl` (not yet a dep) + a study of the `Climate`
worksheet layout against `PHX/PHPP/sheet_io/io_climate.py`. The
storage/API/MCP layer is provider-agnostic; PHI plugs in via the same
`seed_dataset(...)` once a parser exists.

## Next step

**3a is complete** (tab + dataset browser + record tables + the migrated
location editor; Settings now read-only). **3b backend is landed**
(`project_climate_source` model + routes + MCP + tests; 2026-06-14) — the
remaining 3b slice is the **frontend attach/select UI** (source roster +
default radio + per-kind attach; see `phase-03b-…` §Outcome). Then **3c**
(charting-lib decision + monthly graphs + the sun-path visual, coordinated
with `model-viewer-sun-path`). Independent follow-ups still open: (a) the
PHI xlsx importer (deferred; see phase-02 §5); (b) promote `ClimateRecord`
to a `context/` reference doc.

## Decisions

- **Implemented as recommended (Phase 1):** D-CL-1 (extends, not
  replaces `project_location`), D-CL-2 (sun-path service home + shared
  `GET /projects/{id}/sun-path` endpoint), D-PL-4 (true-north sign =
  identity, fixture-verified).
- **Implemented as recommended (Phase 2):** D-CL-10 (`ClimateRecord`
  PINNED to mirror `honeybee_ph.site`; adapters not subclassing —
  round-trip verified), **D-CL-8 (app-wide versioned reference
  datasets — `climate_dataset*` tables)**. The Phius `-mon.txt` parser
  landed and is **revalidated against the real 1007-station set**; the
  `io_climate.py` reuse for the PHI seed is the deferred slice.
- **Resolved (Ed 2026-06-13, for Phase 3):** **D-CL-3 setter
  migration** — migrate the rich location editor into the Climate tab,
  leaving a compact read-only summary in Settings. **Tab placement** —
  Climate sits near the front of `PROJECT_TABS`, right after Status.
- **Resolved (Ed 2026-06-13):** D-CL-4 (store all sources; ASHRAE
  pointer).
- **Implemented (Phase 3a) — D-CL-3 fully done:** the Climate tab exists,
  placed after Status, and **owns the location editor**; project Settings
  keeps only a compact read-only summary that points to the tab.
- **Proposed, recommended (confirm on review):** D-CL-6 (store the EPW),
  D-CL-7 (durable + editable location; reproducibility via pinning).
- **Implemented (Phase 3b backend, 2026-06-14):** **D-CL-4** (store all
  sources — `project_climate_source`, one row per attached source),
  **D-CL-9** (custom standardized record stored as the `custom` kind's
  `data`), **D-CL-11** (one project default, partial-unique enforced +
  `PUT …/default`). The frontend attach/select UI is the remaining 3b slice.
- **Deferred to later feature work (Ed 2026-06-13):** the design-
  conditions/use-case layer (Phase 4) and **D-CL-5** (fRSI interior
  assumption) and the temperature-asymmetry use-case. Focus is the data
  store first.
- **Settled:** ASHRAE stays a pointer for now (D-CL-4).

## Blockers

- None for Phase 3 (Phase 1 + Phase 2 endpoints exist; Phius dataset
  real + seeded).
- **PHI/PHPP seed** deferred (Ed 2026-06-13, behind the Phase-3 tab).
  Investigated: the xlsx is a live PHPP `Climate` worksheet with the
  library embedded as ~130 unlabeled formula columns × ~1000 datasets
  (`io_climate.py` only reads the active climate, not the library) — a
  full anchor-and-validate session, not a quick parser. See phase-02 §5
  Deferred for the recovery plan.
- Phase 4 is deferred (later feature work).

## Phase ledger

| Phase | State | Gate |

| 3 — Climate tab UI | **In progress** — 3a **complete** (tab + dataset browser + record tables + migrated location editor; Settings now read-only; `make ci` green). Remaining: 3b + 3c (own docs) | Phase 1 + Phase 2 (met) |
| 2b — PHI/PHPP importer (`phase-02b-…`) | **Deferred** — ~130-col PPP-worksheet reverse-engineering + `openpyxl`; seed seam ready | independent |
| 3b — Source attach/select (`phase-03b-…`) | **In progress** — backend **landed** 2026-06-14 (`project_climate_source` table + migration, repo/service, REST CRUD + set-default, MCP list/set-default, tests; `make ci` green). Frontend attach/select UI remains | 3a complete (met) |
| 3c — Visualization (`phase-03c-…`) | **Deferred/planned** — charting-lib decision + monthly graphs + sun-path visual | after 3b |
| 4 — Design conditions + metrics | **Deferred** (later feature work) | scheduled fRSI/comfort consumer (+ D-CL-5) |

See `PLAN.md` → "Deferred work index" for the suggested order across these
later phases.
